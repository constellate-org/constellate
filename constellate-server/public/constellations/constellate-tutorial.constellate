There are many different types of stars, but most of them combine some text, as a Markdown cell, with some kind of visual, as a Python cell. Because this is a Markdown cell that isn't followed up by any kind of visual or code, it renders as a standalone Markdown star.\n\nPress <kbd>?</kbd> to see some useful keyboard shortcuts for navigating Constellations.

There should be only one of these per document, ideally in the first Markdown cell.\n - Second-level headings, like `## Document Structure`, define sections. These show up in the table of contents: clicking the link will send you back to this cell.\n - Third-level headings, like `### Sections and Subsections`, define subsections. These only show up in the table of contents when the reader is inside the containing section: you can see \"Sections and Subsections\" inside the table of contents now, but if you go back to the last star it won't appear.",

However, in some cases Constellate can't deduce what you want and you have to add some extra information. That extra information is given in the form of *directives*. Directives are lines at the beginning of cells that start with `#constellate: `. Here are the directives Constellate currently uses:\n\n- `#constellate: ignore` makes Constellate ignore the cell it appears in. It won't affect document structure or render at all. This can be used for cells that set up some aspect of the Jupyter notebook environment, like installing packages, or whenever you want to do something without it rendering in the output.\n- `#constellate: setup` marks a cell as a *setup cell*. Setup cells contain Python code that is run before plots are generated. Use it to import libraries, define custom functions, set constants, or whatever else. These cells do not appear in the final output and do not affect document structure. They are run in the order they appear, but they are all run before generating a plot: this means that setup cells can affect the output of cells that are before them in the notebook.\n- `#constellate: latex` indicates that a Markdown cell should be rendered as an image of LaTeX and not as a separate text cell. (This will be explained in more detail later.)\n- `#constellate: setup_[backend]` marks a cell as a setup cell that only applies to a specific kind of plot. For example, `setup_matplotlib` is only run before Matplotlib output. Backends will be discussed in more detail later.",

Constellate will then display that PNG image in the side panel, along with the code that generated it. Constellate's first-class support of dark mode shines here: Constellate will generate a light and dark version of each plot separately and display the appropriate one.[^1] Note how the colors change with dark mode: the dark blue becomes a lighter blue that still maintains contrast with the background.\n\nOn the right is a complicated figure that shows off the default Constellate theming. Note how a `#constellate: setup_matplotlib` directive keeps the stock imports out of the cell, as they are in most notebooks, so the code is just the relevant part that actually makes the plot. The code will be formatted using `black`, so don't worry about the formatting too much in the notebook.\n\n[^1]: One consequence of this is that hardcoding colors will not look good: if you write text using a hardcoded color like `'black'`, it'll be unreadable in dark mode. `c1` through `c10` will be the colors in the color cycle (the whole list will be `cs`), which will adapt to the mode. For example, `c1` is a blue that will adjust to match the theme. Other parts of the plot theme are also set before running the cell, so using `plt.rcParams['text.color']` will be an appropriate text color regardless of mode. The constant `IS_DARK` is also set before running the cell, so if you need to you can use that.",

There are a couple differences from the `matplotlib` renderer to know about:\n- Plotly cells aren't re-run by Constellate: the output data from the cell itself is used.[^1] This means that `setup_plotly` cells have no effect, and unlike `matplotlib` you cannot customize the output using `IS_DARK` or the named colors. You also have to run the cell in order for Constellate to see the output.\n- Dark mode compatibility is achieved by modifying the plotly template used to render the figure. Fuller support for this is planned, but for now the background and main colors will change appropriately.\n- Writing TeX in Plotly should work, although achieving this without increasing the bundle size is a work in progress.\n\nTo demonstrate, here's a 3D visual that benefits tremendously from the ability to rotate the camera.\n\n[^1]: The reason for this is that Plotly has no concept of the current figure in the way that Matplotlib does, so Constellate wouldn't know what figure to render if it re-ran the cell. A technical workaround for this is in progress.",

Because the tools can be backed by Python servers, you can support visualizations using arbitrary Python code and arbitrary data. For example, you can show the output of a machine learning model trained in Tensorflow or PyTorch without having to port that code to Javascript. One of the features that sets Constellate apart is seamlessly handling these interactive webapps just as it handles static images or JS-driven interactivity.\n\nHere's an example Panel app that displays a beta distribution and lets you change the parameters.",

      "markdown": "### Markdown Tables\n\nIf a Python cell outputs a Pandas DataFrame, then Constellate will show the table using a fairly sophisticated component. Some features to note:\n- Numbers, booleans, datetimes, currencies, and JSON are automatically recognized: note how the numeric columns, including the dollar values, are right-aligned while everything else is left-aligned. This also allows for intelligent sorting behavior.\n- Pagination is automatic, allowing for a relatively efficient render even for large datasets.\n  - Note that, while Constellate's DataFrame rendering scales relatively well, it still keeps the entire dataset in memory and sends it to the client when they load the page. Anything not on the first page doesn't have to be rendered, but it does have to be sent to the browser, which will cripple load times for very large datasets. Instead, use a `Tabulator` widget as a Panel plot, which can send a server request to get more data.\n\nLike Plotly, Constellate has to guess what the DataFrame value is: there's no \"current DataFrame\" feature in Pandas. The heuristic Constellate applies is simple: the last non-empty line is assumed to be the one that produces the DataFrame. This is usually correct, but is not bulletproof, and so be aware that you will most likely run into issues if you do things like display a DataFrame manually instead of simply having it be the last expression. To make sure Constellate knows exactly what to do, give it a directive: `#constellate: dataframe [expr]` where `expr` is a Python expression to be run after the cell that produces a DataFrame. The code for this Star would produce the same results if I had started with `#constellate: dataframe` or `#constellate: dataframe exch`.",
